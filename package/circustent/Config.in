  The CircusTent infrastructure is designed to provide users 
  and architects the ability to discover the relevant performance 
  of a target system architecture's memory subsystem using atomic memory operations. 
  Atomic memory operations have traditionally been considered to be latent or low performance 
  given the difficulty in their respective implementations.
